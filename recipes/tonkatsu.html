            <h2>Description</h2>
            Tonkatsu (トンカツ) is one of the most beloved “western style” Japanese food in Japan.  It is a pork chop breaded with flour, egg, and Panko (bread crumbs), then deep fried.
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bonless pork</li>
                <li>Egg</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pound the pork loin or pork chop flat until it's about ¾ inch thick. Using scissors or a knife, cut slits into the outer white membrane of the pork. This prevents it from curling up as it cooks. Next, coat it with flour and shake off the excess.</li>
                <li>Add a tablespoon of flour to the egg and mix them together. This creates a thicker egg wash that allows for more breadcrumbs to stick to. Dip the pork into the beaten egg and let the excess drip off.</li>
                <li>Transfer the pork to the panko bread crumbs and press firmly to create a thick layer of bread crumbs that won't flake off in the fryer. Be sure to cover any bare spots with breading.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil to 340 degrees F over medium heat. Medium heat is essential to cook the pork thoroughly without burning the bread crumbs.</li>
                <li>Gently lower the pork cutlet into the fryer and deep fry it for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Flip and fry the other side until the pork is fully cooked and the panko coating is golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Try to keep the temperature at 340 degrees F for even cooking. Repeat with any remaining cutlets.</li>
            </ol>
